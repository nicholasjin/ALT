# Azur Lane Toolbox (ALT)
This utility is intended to be a game analytics/simulation engine. For now, we're going to settle on an extremely simple:
1. Compute the paper dps of every ship in the game, ignoring barrage and skills, against a variety of targets.
2. Compute "stat weights" based on this paper dps.
3. Compute the paper ehp of every ship in the game, against a variety of damage profiles.

Later, we'll look at implementing raidbots-like functionality, allowing end users to pick the environments they'd like to simulate ship performance in.
